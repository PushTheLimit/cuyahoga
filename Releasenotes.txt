Cuyahoga release notes

===========================================================================
0.8.0 - 2005-06-11
===========================================================================
New features:
- RemoteContent module. This module consumes external RSS feeds and 
  displays the content. Currently only RSS 2.0 is supported.
- Downloads module. Publish files on the web site that are available as
  download for site visitors. The permissions (allowed roles) can be set
  per file.
- Timezone support for logged-in users. All display dates are adjusted to
  the timezone of the user.
  
Improvements:
- Friendly readable urls (configurable per site).
- Security settings of nodes can be propagated to child nodes and sections.
- Allow persisten logins.

Bugfixes:
- Edit hyperlinks show up when the user only has view access.
- Deleting nodes fails when they are in a custom menu.
- Removing nodes leaves the order of the nodes in an inconsistent state. 


===========================================================================
0.7.0.1 - 2005-04-04
===========================================================================
- Fixed bug when registering a new user (LastLogin should be NULL, but was 
  DateTime.MinValue).
- Fixed bug in PostgreSQL create script (showtitle in section).


===========================================================================
0.7.0 - 2005-03-29
===========================================================================
New features:

- Custom menus. You can now add custom menu's to every placeholder in the 
  template. The menu items point to existing nodes in the site. Visibility
  of nodes in the regular navigation/menu's can be turned off.
- Site aliases. A site has a default url that consists of the host and the 
  application name. A new feature was added to map alternative url's to the
  site, or a specific node in the site.

Improvements:
- All related template controls, stylesheets and images  are 
  now grouped in subdirectories in the Templates directory. The default 
  installation comes with two subdirectories, 'Default' and 'Classic'. Css 
  files always have to be in the Css subdirectory (for example, 
  'Templates/Default/Css').
  BREAKING CHANGE FOR EXISTING USERS: The path of the Template controls
  is now split into a base path (for example 'Templates/Default') and the 
  name of the template control ('CuyahogaNew.ascx'). After upgrading, 
  reorganize your physical files just like the default files and then go
  to the template adminstration and correct the values for the base path,
  template control and css.
- Templates can be changed any time now, even if there are sections 
  attached. Cuyahoga displays a warning when sections belong to a
  placeholder that is not found in the selected template.
- Support for MySQL 4.0 (was 4.1 and above).
- The site url doesn't care anymore about casing or trailing slashes.
  
Bugfixes:
- When there are ModuleSettings in the database that can not be found as
  a type, Cuyhoga throws an exception instead of returning null (and 
  causing a lot of misunderstanding).
- The calendar control now handles all regional settings for dates.
- Converted all table and column names to lowercase, because of errors
  with MySQL on Linux. It's more consistent now too.
  
Thanks to Ayende Rahien, Richard Bourque and sleuth for the heads up.
