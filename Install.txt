Installing Cuyahoga from source.

1. Unzip the files to a local directory.

2. Create a database. Supported databases are:
    - SQL Server 2000 / MSDE 2000
    - PostgreSQL 7.4 and higher
    - MySQL 4.1 and higher

3. Run the following scripts from the Database folder:

    create-core-***.sql (where *** is mssql2000 or postgresql, depending on the platform)
    create-modules-***.sql
    init-***.sql

4. Build and run.

    There are 2 possible ways to build Cuyahoga: using Visual Studio .NET 2003 (VS.NET) or NAnt.
    
    4a. Building with VS.NET.
        - Open Cuyahoga.sln with VS.NET.
        - Build Solution.
        - Create an IIS application (virtual directory) that points to the Web folder.
        - Change the connection string in the Web.config (hibernate.connection.connection_string)
          to the database that is created in step 2.
          
          Example (SQL Server):
          <add key="hibernate.connection.connection_string" value="server=(local);database=Cuyahoga;uid=***;pwd=***;" />  	
          
          Example (PostgreSQL):
          <add key="hibernate.connection.connection_string" value="server=192.168.0.1;port=5432;database=Cuyahoga;uid=***;pwd=***;" />  	
        - If you want to run/debug the application from VS.NET you have to change the 
          default Start Action: 
          Go to Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging. Change debug mode
          to 'URL' and set the Start URL to the url of the created IIS application 
          (for example http://localhost/cuyahoga).
          
    4b. Building with NAnt.
        - Make sure you have a 0.85 version of NAnt (http://nant.sourceforge.net).
        - Open a command prompt, go to the directory where you extracted the .zip file.
        - Enter 'nant'. This will create a build directory with the compiled binaries and the 
          libraries (for example 'build/net-1.1.win32/Cuyahoga-0.5-debug').
        - Enter 'nant deploy' to add the other files needed to run Cuyahoga to the build.
        - Create an IIS application that points to the build directory or copy the files in the
          build directory to the root directory of an existing IIS application.
        - Change the connection string in the Web.config (hibernate.connection.connection_string)
          to the database that is created in step 2. See 4a for example connection strings.
          
    You are now ready to run the application. Before the fun starts you have to create a site
    first. Open a web browser and go to the web site administration. The url is
    http://HOST_NAME/APPLICATION_NAME/Admin (for example http://localhost/cuyahoga/Admin). Log in
    with user 'admin' and password 'hyena'. Start playing around and see if you manage to get a 
    web site up and running :). Don't forget to change the admin password!
    
Hints and tips:
- Check the setting in the Web.config for the location where the uploaded files are placed:
  
  <appSettings>
    <add key="FCKeditor:UserFilesPath" value="/Cuyahoga/UserFiles" />
  </appSettings>
  
- You can enable logging to uncomment the <log4net> section in the Web.config. Make sure your
  ASP.NET user has write access to the path of the logfile.
- Give the ASP.NET user write access for the Web/UserFiles directory to enable uploading images or
  other files.
